# RSpec File Chef
The main idea of this gem is saving previous state of tracking files after running RSpec. It should be helpful when your project is using own local files for record some data or a log. And you don't want that RSpec will change it. Or you don't want to get a lot of temporary test files in your project root folder after your tests complete.

## Features

- Tracking of necessary files
  - Supporting of virtual files
  - Saving/restoring current state of tracking files
- Supporting of tracking files test examples
- Ability to use custom location for test examples and temp directory

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rspec_file_chef'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rspec_file_chef
